[Verse Two: Cappadonna]

Yo, I seen you at the five and dime wastin your time
Oh you shine, I'm lookin at your ass from behind
You walked by smellin like watermelon
You might make me a felon, my eyeballs swellin
My nuts start yellin, excuse my prick
Wanna have a talk with you, I'm sick
My medicine is can I walk with you, fantasy
After that we can cheat, laid on the bed
Handcuffed with hard meat, long stroke smackin
Smack it then broke, nothin can't stop my
continous poke, compound
Porno flick music, Daddy came with it when I wrote it
