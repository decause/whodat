[Verse Three: Cappadonna]

Yo, yo, this is Beirut
Try to comprehend check out my new suit
Gods blend aim take fire pure destruction
Dissapear from here, my year, drop the stupid LP's everywhere
Fallin out the sky tall sniper
Raps by Cappadonna hit the countryside
Poetry whirlpool, RZA and True collide
We produce article exception to the rule
We the black men that struck oil, the hardboiled
Cats that made that Watergate thing go spoiled
The heavy-handed, locked down stranged with Cyrus
Wu Pirates, sneak inside the club, low eyes
Low down dirty, twelve thirty, night time crawlers
Off-the-wallers, basketball gun brawlers
Smoked out throw both fists for nine-seven
Slang reverand, put the best work in
